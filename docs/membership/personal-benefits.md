## We respect the privacy of our members

Membership is essentially **anonymous** and the **list of members is confidential** - we do not require or collect any personal information about our members unless they explicitly declare that they want to be listed publicly.

We only need one verifiable identifier, which can be an email or cryptocurrency address (private key), which is used to prove your membership.
