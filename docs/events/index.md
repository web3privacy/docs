# Events

Our event concept is based on creating a unified schedule of events for the entire season and spreading events over whole year and different locations. Instead of just doing one huge event in one location that only happens for a day or two, we are trying to create something like a "distributed conference".

We aim to produce high quality events that bring a very similar atmosphere and content to many venues around the world, providing a unique experience for visitors, speakers and other participants.

## List of events

All our events and RSVPs can be found on our website:

* [web3privacy.info/events](https://web3privacy.info/events)

import EventListScreen from '../assets/events-list.png';

### Lu.ma calendar

Alternatively, announced events are available in our lu.ma calendar:

* [lu.ma/web3privacy](https://lu.ma/web3privacy)

## Source data

The source files with basic data about our events can be found in our `data` [Git repository](/git):

* [`@web3privacy/data`](https://github.com/web3privacy/data) (`src/events` directory)

Feel free to edit or modify!

## Seasons

In terms of time, everything is divided into individual programme seasons or planning periods. For us, this is the calendar year.

Prior to each season, each [regional team](/events/regional-teams) will prepare a unified event plan for the entire region.

Within the season, all events are prepared together as one package. This also applies to partners and speakers, which are gathered for the whole package.

* Current season: [2024](/events/seasons/2024)
* Past seasons: [2023](/events/seasons/2023)

### Season Budget

Each season as a whole has a predetermined budget that we want to raise from sponsors and donors. These funds are then used to cover the costs associated with organising these events.

The Season Budget consists of budget approved by Web3Privacy Now [association](/association/).

## Regions

The basic division by location is into major regions according to wider regions or continents (e.g. Europe, LATAM, etc.). 

### [Regional teams](/events/regional-teams)

[Regional teams](/events/regional-teams) are responsible for organising events in a specific region. We only start doing events within a region if we have enough people forming a [regional organization team](/events/regional-teams).

### Regions we cover (2024)

For the 2024 season, we want to cover the following regions:

* **Europe** - Europe regional team (EthCC, ETHBerlin, ETHDam, ETHPrague and many more)
* **Devcon (Southeast Asia)**

Our goal in each region is to spread the events evenly, both in time and space across the entire region (or important events that take place there).

## Date and location

Most of our events are held in conjunction with another major Ethereum event in the region (e.g. Devcon(nect), EthCC, ETHBerlin, ETHPrague, etc.).

Our aim is to cover these big events and offer an alternative to expand the numbers of our supporters.

We are also preparing a couple of separate events within the season, which are intended to complement our event portfolio. These may be events that fill in the less popular periods (eq. Barcelona meetup in winter) or it may be our own Web3Privacy Now hackathon or team building.

## Event types

We divide events into the following types according to their length and goal:

* [Hackathon](./types#hackathon) - a multi-day event including hacking
* [Summit](./types#summit) -  a day-long gathering
* [Meetup](./types#meetup) - shorter gatherings for a few hours

[List of event types →](./types)

## Slots

Each event is composed of a predetermined number of slots.

Slots serves as a basic breakdown of the programme of each event. Each slot can be occupied by a talk, workshop, panel debate, etc. (see [Program formats](#program-formats)).

The standard duration of one slot is 30 minutes.

## Program formats

At each event, the program is made up of [slots](#slots) that are filled with different formats.

[List of program formats →](./formats)

## Production

### Budget

Funds to pay for event expenses and services come from the shared [Season Budget](#season-budget) dedicated for the season.

The amount to be provided for a particular event depends on the [type of event](/events/types), its duration and other parameters.

### Legal entity

Legal cover for events is handled by our [association](/association/).

### Visual identity

TODO

### Catering

The food and drink provided at a particular event is based on other circumstances, such as the amount of admission or duration of the event. Basically, we try to provide our visitors with as much comfort as possible without spending too much.

On the shortest Meetups there is minimal catering water and snacks like fruit, bagels, pizza or similar.

At longer Summits or Hackathons (or paid events) we try to offer a full range of food and drink, including lunch, dinner and various desserts and drinks (incl. beer).

### Content recording

All content at all our events (Meetup, Summit, Hackathon) is recorded (unless stated otherwise). For this purpose we use our own low-cost [Recording setup](./recording).

Larger events such as the Summits can also be streamed online.

## Visitors

### Admission

Whether a particular event is free or we charge admission will depend on the context. The entrance fee and its amount are mainly taken as a tool for self-regulation of the number and quality of visitors.

We will apply admission fees where we expect a lot of interest and, on the contrary, events in less busy periods should be free of charge, which will serve as an incentive for visitors.

All our [members](/membership/#personal-membership) have a **free admission** to event, even if an entry fee is applied.

### Pre-registration

With the start of each [season](#seasons) we will start pre-registration for **all events** within that season. Potential visitors will be able to express their preferences for when and where they want to attend our events.

The only private information we collect for pre-registration will be name and email. Visitors are advised to use a [privacy email provider](https://www.privacytools.io/privacy-email) like [Skiff Mail](https://skiff.com/mail) or [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail).

Pre-registration will be done through temporary event profiles on the [lu.ma platform](https://lu.ma/web3privacy).

Approximately 2-3 months prior to the event, the final registration will open and all people will be notified via the email they entered during pre-registration (see [Ticketing](#ticketing)).

### Ticketing

Final ticketing (registration) starts the moment we have a confirmed date and location, usually 2-3 months before the event.

* Free admission - profile and registration on lu.ma
* Paid admission - lu.ma OR special website and custom payment gateway (like Pretix)

All those who have pre-registered are notified of final registration via email.

#### Payment methods

We usually accept these payment methods:
* fiat
  * payment cards
* cryptocurrencies
  * BTC, BTC (Lightning)
  * ETH and stablecoins (also L2s)
  * XMR

## Speakers

We are looking for speakers for all events combined using a single [Call for Proposal (CfP)](/events/cfp) form.

Within this form, speakers are able to choose the months and locations that suit them. This will offer speakers great flexibility in when and where they can present their ideas or projects.

## Partners

If you are interested in visibility of your organization at our events, then we have the following options for you:

### Members (General Partners)

Your organisation can become [organisational member](/membership/#membership-for-organizations) of Web3Privacy Now and automatically gain visibility at our events, depending on the Tier choosen.
