## The Challenge: Equal Empowerment of Privacy

In a world where connected humans are unknowingly commodified and surveilled, urgent change is needed.

The Web3 stack promotes data, privacy, and security awareness, acting as a lifelong educational partner for everyone.

We produce and curate knowledge to empower individuals restoring their agency in our hyperconnected reality.

## Our Approach:

**Advocacy** 
- **Educate**: Facilitate education via frameworks, 101 master classes, lectures & guides (for both general & tech public)
- **Research**: Build foundation blocks for the industry: standards, projects' database, best practices, ethics
- **Partner**: Outreach journalists, institutions, researchers, white hackers, and data economy academics & engage them in private topics
- **Workspace**: Promote privacy as a work of the future top-of-mind career choice in web3

**Collaboration**
- Build a community centered around web3 privacy
- Contribute to industrial reports & surveys
- Initiate new hackathons, lectures, and events for builders & product managers
- Amplify knowledge sharing and collaboration between privacy companies
- Connect traditional data & privacy experts with web3 leaders

**Tooling**
- Champion products that prioritize privacy
- Advocate for open-source development
- Promote humanistic UX/UI-culture
- Support cutting-edge R&D projects

# **Ultimate goal**

**Empowering individuals to take control of their digital privacy through the Web3 stack.**

_We envision a world where privacy is a conscious, actively chosen lifestyle, accessible to everyone, everywhere._
