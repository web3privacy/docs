## Local-first privacy cases

This is a research project aimed at bridging the gap between local privacy violations x events the community is doing (meetups, summits, congresses & hackathons).

It's part of the "social layer" activity fostering political awareness among developers so that they will tackle local & not just global issues.

**Case scenario**: web3 hackathon landing in the new city; our goal - introduce local-specific privacy stories, so developers can try to solve them (censorship resistance in Turkey, journalist leaks in Mexico, safe communication within occupied territories in Ukraine). 

**Template for the data collection**

| Name  | Description | Type of privacy | Threat actors | Negative impact |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- | ------------- | 
| Racial profiling while renting | "Berlin (and Germany in general) have a massive problem of racism in housing" | visual profiling | individuals | less renting opportunities, hostility & social disturbance | 

## Test phase
We will commit to aggregate local use-cases prior to two events:
- Web3privacy now meetup x ETHRome, 3 Oct [event link](https://lu.ma/w3pn-meetup-rome1)
- Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress x Devcon (Bangkok), 11 Nov: [event link](http://congress.web3privacy.info)

_note: privacy cases will be managed by local representatives - this will ensure accuracy within cases aggregation._
