title: Privacy Idea Generator
---

**Problem**: Hackathon participants often struggle to find privacy-focused project ideas or build solutions that aren't applicable to real-world privacy challenges. This leads to poor post-hackathon product sustainability.

**Solution**: A curated collection of privacy-focused project ideas that can be filtered and discovered with one click. Powered by community contributions, expert recommendations, and organizational project suggestions.

Generate privacy ideas instantly to build meaningful privacy solutions.
