## Who is a contributor?

A *contributor* is anyone who supports our [Mission](https://web3privacy.info/about/) by actively participating in our [Projects](#projects), co-editing [research](https://github.com/orgs/web3privacy/projects/11/views/1) and [publications](https://mirror.xyz/0x0f1F3DAf416B74DB3DE55Eb4D7513a80F4841073), providing structured feedbacks, volunteering at events, or starting a whole new project.

Contributors are typically organized into Workgroups aligned with their skills and interests, each guided by one or more shepherds.

Frequent contributors have the opportunity to become [Core Contributors](/governance/core-contributors/) and be rewarded for their contributions to open source.

## Projects

*Project* is the basic unit of work by which we coordinate ourselves. 

An example of a project is [Research](/research) or [Events](/events) or [Privacy Explorer](/projects/privacy-explorer). Each of these top-level projects is a separate unit with its own autonomy and may have other sub-projects (such as a specific event or specific research report, etc.). 

Every project is open for collaboration!
Check our [Projects registry](https://github.com/orgs/web3privacy/projects/12)

**How to join a project**:
_If you want to get involved in a project, you can either navigate the ones we are carrying on and do pull requests (see below) or write to the people leading it, the shepherds._

**How to start new project:**
_Publish and discuss a concept of your project in our [Projects registry](https://github.com/web3privacy/projects/issues) detailing the necessary requirements for initiation and maintenance, such as timing, funding, social media outreach, and design._

_Shepherds: _[Mykola](@nicksvyaznoy),[PG](https://x.com/PG_CDG)_

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to maintain our privacy DB updated via PR at GitHub:

**Actualization**
_goal_: up to date info in the database
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Pick up a category (from DeFi to Infrastructure)
3. Check:
- product-readiness (actual state: devnet, testnet, mainnet)
- team status (public, anon)
- github/docs-readiness (available/not)
- ecosystem
- token (yes/no/Coinmarketcap link).
4. Add missing data & make a PR.

**Categorisation**
_goal_: broader list of categories within the privacy market.
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check ["other"](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy#Other) & ["dapps"](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy#dapps) categories.
3. Find sub-categories (min 3-4 projects per category). Examples: "marketplaces" or "data lakes".
4. Once a new sub-category has been found - create it & move those projects under it.

**Sunset**
_goal_: actual information on terminated or abandoned projects.
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check sunset projects (Twitter &/or Discord activity, GitHub activity).
3. 6 months hiatus - mark them with an icon of the moon next to them.

**Category Accuracy**

_goal_: check Infrastructure, dApps, Other categories if projects really belong there (some projects misslead readers pretending to be infrastructure, for example)
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check projects' website, documentation.
3. Make observations if a projects belongs to particular category (infrastructure - providing broader protocol toolkit for different decentralised implementations).
4. If project nature differs from category where it exists - move it to the right category.
