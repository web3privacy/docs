title: Benefits for Organizations
---

Here you will find a detailed description of the benefits of membership for organisations.

Instead of proposing partnership agreements for every event and/or initiative, we are implementing a continuous and flexible membership approach. 
This will:

1. Help to meet our respective specific and market needs
2. Avoid wasting time and resources. 
3. Guarantee visibility and services by leveraging all our ecosystem and activities, and to structure a common growth path.
