## **Current project status (v2)** 

**Context**: we were actively participating in hackathons core at ETHRome & core at ETHDam, judging & speaking, making [Privacy Corner](https://c24ber.web3privacy.info) at ETHBerlin.

We understood that many people came into privacy after Tornado Cash case or Vitalik promoting privacy solutions & cypherpunk spirit.
But hackers don't get privacy in the bigger context:

- Surveillance capitalism business models.
- Centralization of knowledge.
- Proprietary software etc.

**Idea:** The Privacy Builder Pack (PBP) is designed to empower devs to move beyond one-off projects and build privacy-first applications that can scale and thrive in the long term.

### Goals
- **Make meaningful privacy-solutions** -> so accidental in privacy people will do not a dead code.
- **Build sustainable privacy projects** -> turn hackathon demos into products that will stay.
- **Re-wire crypto funds into value alligned hands** -> match conscious devs with good mentors, grant programs etc.
