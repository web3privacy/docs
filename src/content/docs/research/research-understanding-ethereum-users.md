title: "Understanding Ethereum Users’ Risk Perceptions and Privacy Practices"
---

**Research paper submitted for review in 2025**

# Abstract
Privacy is a critical, unresolved challenge for blockchain adoption, and Ethereum is no exception. While privacy-preserving tools hold great promise, it’s widely known that many users shy away from using them, mainly due to a lack of awareness/knowledge or ease of use (Ghesmati et al., 2022). To successfully overcome the privacy paradox, — the gap between users’ privacy attitudes and their actual behaviour — it is essential for Ethereum to understand end users’ different risk perceptions and privacy practices when it comes to adopting privacy solutions and thus, resolving privacy issues on a larger scale. This will help to identify users’ privacy skills, along with potential misunderstandings and blind spots related to privacy issues. Based on the study’s findings, Ethereum will be able to address usability issues in current privacy solutions and make sure to maintain its reputation as a secure and trustworthy platform amid evolving privacy challenges. 


# Project Team
The project team consists of two academic researchers (both postdoc level; social sciences and information sciences) and one active industry member from the Web3PrivacyNow team. All of us are well-versed researchers in the blockchain space. We will be working on this project with a combined effort of 1.5 FTE load (~220 hours per month) over 5-6 months:
